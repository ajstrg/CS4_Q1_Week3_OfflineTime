### CS4_Q1_Week3_OfflineTime

## Task

You have determined that your time online is usually spent on the following: KHub, games, youtube, and social media. 
You decide that for however long you spend on each of these, you will try to spend a corresponding time offline.
Write a code that does the following:

- Ask the user about the ratio for each activity (e.g. 1 hour of KHub is equivalent to 0.5 hours of offline time).
- Ask the user what they will do (KHub, game, youtube, social media, end day).
- If the user is not ending the day, ask how they will be online.
- If the user chooses to end the day, display the total online time and how much time should be spent offline.
- If total time (sum of online and offline time) is greater than 24, indicate that the user has spent too much time online.
- Ask the user if they would like to continue the program.
- If continued, all values except those defined in step 1 are reset.
